          <li>
            <strong>Season 1 / 2004</strong> - The season followed Dr. House and his team as they solve a medical case each episode. The season's sub-plot revolved around billionaire Edward Vogler making a $100 million donation to the hospital. Through this donation, Vogler became the new chairman of the board of PPTH, however, seeing House and his team as a waste of time and resources, he decreases their payment, eventually forcing House to fire one of his team members.

            <strong>Season 3 / 2006</strong> - At the beginning of the season, the main storyline centers around House's temporary lack of pain in his leg due to ketamine treatment after being shot in the previous season finale.
